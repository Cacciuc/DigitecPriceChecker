# DigitecPriceChecker
Checks the price for digitec items and sends you an email, if the price changed. Just hacked together; not production code

##How to get it to work
 - Download Visual Studio if you haven't already.
 - Open the DigitecPriceChecker.cs file (not the designer. If you are in the designer press F7)
 - Change the lines 16-19/20 where there's a TODO: comment. This includes the URL of the product, your email address, email password and email providers smtp server
 - Run the program


##Why should I give a random guy my password and email address?
That's why I uploaded the code, so you see exactly what the code does, even if you can't code very well.
Because of that particular question, I did not add all those information into a GUI, but let you hard code it.

##Production?
NO, this is not ment for production. It's just hacked together by me, because the prices changed a few times and I missed them. So I did not want to constantly check the browser for new prices.

##Future proof
NO. This works only now (17.04.2019) until digitec changes their website structure.
